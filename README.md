## Using it
First, you must mount the server. In releases you can see a .zip called "Server-Side", this compressed contains the files and folders that you must upload to an FTP server so that BorocitoCLI can connect to them and thus be used.  
Inside the .zip, you will find the following files and folders:  
 - Boro-Get/  
	 - REPO/  
		 - boro-hear.zip  
		 - broKiloger.zip  
		 - broRescue.zip  
		 - broScrincam.zip  
		 - RMTDSK_Client.zip  
		 - RMTFS_Client.zip  
		 - TeamViewer.zip  
	 - RepoList.ini  
	 - boro-get.ini  
	 - boro-hear.ini  
	 - broKiloger.ini  
	 - broRescue.ini  
	 - broScrincam.ini  
	 - RMTDSK_Client.ini  
	 - RMTFS_Client.ini  
	 - TeamViewer.ini  
 - Files/  
 - Telemetry/  
	 - tlmRefresh.php  
 - Users/  
	 - Commands/  
		 - cliResponde.php  
 - Borocitos.zip  
 - Client.ini  
 - fileUpload.php  
 - GlobalSettings.ini  
 - telemetryPost.php  
 - userReport.php  
  
  
**Pay attention, now I will explain what these files are, one by one.**  
 - Boro-Get/  
	 - REPO/  
		 - boro-hear.zip: Contains the boro-hear plugin binaries.  
	 - RepoList.ini: Contains the information of each plugin that can be used by boro-get. Here are the links to the plugin configuration files.  
	 - boro-get.ini: It contains the basic information of the plugin, such as the version, the author, the page link and the download link of the compressed with the binaries.  
	 - boro-hear.ini: It contains the basic information of the plugin, such as the version, the author, the page link and the download link of the compressed with the binaries. [This is the file listed within RepoList.ini]  
 - Telemetry/  
	 - tlmRefresh.php: This PHP is the one that processes the telemetry sent from the CLI to the server, and from the server to the CMD.  
 - Users/  
	 - Commands/  
		 - cliResponde.php: This is used to process the sends and responses related to the commands. Response from CLI to CMD and sends from CMD to CLI.  
 - Borocitos.zip: Contains the binaries of Borocyte itself. The extractor, the updater and the CLI. It is recommended to always use the latest version of these binaries.  
 - Client.ini: Contains the information about the Borocito assembly itself.
The version and the download link of the compressed that contains the binaries.  
 - fileUpload.php: It is used within the BorocitoCLI command processor. (/Payloads.uploadAfile=...)  
 - GlobalSettings.ini: Contains general information about the BorocitoCLI configuration. This is where the boro-get plugin should be downloaded from.  
 - telemetryPost.php: Used for when a new instance of BorocitoCLI is started. Processes the first information generated by the CLI telemetry.  
 - userReport.php: It processes the information of the user who started an instance of BorocitoCLI for the first time. This file is very important, since it is the one that generates the necessary files and connections to control.  
  
  
All files and folders have a function. So it is important that these are inside your server. Obviously, some URLs need to be modified, since by default they point to my server.  
The files you should modify are:  
 - Boro-Get/  
	 - boro-get.zip>boro-get.txt  
	 - RepoList.ini  
	 - boro-get.ini  
	 - boro-hear.ini  
	 - broKiloger.ini  
	 - broRescue.ini  
	 - broScrincam.ini  
	 - RMTDSK_Client.ini  
	 - RMTFS_Client.ini  
	 - TeamViewer.ini  
 - Client.ini  
 - GlobalSettings.ini  

In these appears my URL to my server. These should be modified with your server URL.  
Now, you can also have some functions taken from my server. This way you avoid updating certain things every time they are updated within this repository. In this way, you also manage to avoid overloading your server (but you could overload mine).  
These files where you can leave my URL of my server are:  
 - Boro-Get/  
	 - boro-get.zip>boro-get.txt  
	 - RepoList.ini  
	 - boro-get.ini  
	 - boro-hear.ini  
	 - broKiloger.ini  
	 - broRescue.ini  
	 - broScrincam.ini  
	 - RMTDSK_Client.ini  
	 - RMTFS_Client.ini  
	 - TeamViewer.ini  
 - Client.ini  
 - GlobalSettings.ini  

**And do not worry. I can't steal your victims. Since the server being injected is yours, it must not be mine.**
